## How to use

The parts are organized like a tree, where there is a unique path to each one. For example `Fastening > Bolts > Rounded > Torx`. The paths obey pre-stablished patterns:

```yaml
Fastening:
    - Bolts: <Head shape>, <Head key>
    - Nuts: <Type>
    - Washers: <Type>
    - Spacers: <Type>

Magnets:
    - Rectangular
    - Round

Motors:
    - Nema

Fans:
    - Axial
    - Blower

Transmission:
    - Gears
    - Belts

Bearings:
    - Linear
    - Trust
    - Axial
```
